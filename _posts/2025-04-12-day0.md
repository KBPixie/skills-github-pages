Holy cow, here we go again. this time with the social pressure of logging my progress publicly. So far, so good. Just brushing up my GitHub skills before getting too deep into things. 

First chalenge: I acidentally edited a readme file instead of the index file and blew up my progress. don't be like me, kids.
