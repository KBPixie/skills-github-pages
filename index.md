... to get in the way ðŸ˜‰

After 7-ish years, I'm picking up where I left off (somewhat). Where have I been? What have I done? So much. 
- became a product expert in 3 SaaS products
- grew my leadership skills in technical and billing support
- learned project management and sprint planning
- learned the dangers of feeling "like family" in an organization

I'll get into it all later; for now, onward.
